## Welcome to DemiTasse
Copyright Â© 2013 Robin Murray

DemiTasse is an integrated development environment for 
the [Mini-Java](http://www.cambridge.org/us/features/052182060X/index.html) 
programming language.  It has primitive features that allow
users to edit, compile, and execute Mini-Java programs within the IDE.  It also
also allows users to create, and execute suites of mini-java programs.  In future phases
of the project, DemiTasse will be more than just an IDE.  The hope is to develope a .NET control
and library which developers can use to provide scripting abilities to applications.


## Getting Started

DemiTasse is being developed with Visual Studio 2010.  No additioanl libraries are necessary outside
of those delivered with Visual Studio.  Use the GitHub tools to download the source code onto
your machine.  Once the project is downloaded, double-click the DemiTasse.sln solution file to open 
the DemiTasse project into the IDE.  From the Build menu, select Rebuild All (Note: this step is important to 
assure that all files have been synced to your machine).

Mini-Java sample files can be found at the following web site: [http://www.cambridge.org/resources/052182060X/#programs](http://www.cambridge.org/resources/052182060X/#programs).

## Issues / Enhancements

Please review issues list to view

* The Parsers generated by the [JavaCC](https://java.net/projects/javacc/) tool were defined as static classes, and they share common code.  I'm
sure a better OOD can be achieved for these classes.
* The compiling portions of the IDE code should be better encapsulated within a DLL. 
* Compiling should happen on a thread seperate from the UI thread.
* All MIni-Java source file editing functionality should be moved early into it's own control.
* Exchange test suite functionality for n-unit unit testing.

Additional Information can be found in the [Issues section...](https://github.com/robin5/DemiTasse/issues).

## Blue Sky

* Editor color coding of mini-java language.
* Auto-completion.
