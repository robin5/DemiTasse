## Welcome to DemiTasse

The DemiTassi project will provide at first, an integrated development environment for 
the [Mini-Java](http://www.cambridge.org/us/features/052182060X/index.html) 
programming language.  It will have very primitive features that will allow
users to edit, compile, and execute Mini-Java programs within the IDE.  It will
also have the ability to assemble, and execute suite of mini-java programs.  But
DemiTasse will be more than just an IDE.  The hope is to develope a .NET control
and library which developers could use to provide scripting abilities to applications.


## Getting Started

DemiTasse is being developed with Visual Studio 2010.  No additioanl libraries are necessary outside
of those delivered with Visual Studio.  You can use any of the GitHub tools to create a directory
on your machine for installing the source code.  Once the project is downloaded, you simply
double-click the DemiTasse.sln solution file to open the DemiTasse project.

The tst directory contains mini-java test files that can be used to test the mini-java compiler's functionality.

## Code Status

The current source code has mostly been done to prove feasibility. It was first created by professor Jingke li
for the CS-321 and CS-322 compiler class sequence.  The parsers were generated by the JavaCC compiler tool.
I have done the initial conversion to C#.  The code can execute successfully all of the files we used
to test compiler functionality.  But there is still lots of work to be done (See below).
